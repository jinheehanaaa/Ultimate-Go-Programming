<summary>001: Design Guidelines</summary>

# Mental Model for Backend Developer
## 1. Integrity
- Read/Write to Memory (Micro-level)
- Data transformation (Macro-level)
- Less code (No getters & setters)
- Error handling (Prevent critical failures)
## 2. Readability
- Don't hide the code
- - Ex: C++'s constructors, destructor features => Difficult to understand "Behavior & Cost" of code
## 3. Simplicity
- Encapsulation (Hiding complexity)
